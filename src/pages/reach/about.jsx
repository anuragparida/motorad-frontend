                Our Vision &amp; Mission
              </h5>
              <p>
                EMotorad (EM) believes 'electric' is the future of mobility and with the Indian Market yet to reach anywhere close to its fullest potential, the Indian automotive segment has already taken a significant step towards its autonomous future. EM hopes to play a critical role in spreading awareness of the same, engaging end consumers and delivering the products fitting their requirements at a price they can afford, we like to call it affordable luxury.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company aims to bring across top quality electric cycles which would currently cost much higher in the Indian market at an affordable price utilising its local sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. EM strongly believes in the fact that the local setup will not only help reduce the pricing but will also bring about innovations and job creations in various parts of the country where we plan to expand.
